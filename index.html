        This is a short chronicle of (most of) the places I've lived. Each city
        is accompanied by a song; the songs are not necessarily representative
        of the cities, but rather songs that make me think of the cities for
        personal reasons (or that were very popular while I lived there).

              Andrews is a small, remote town on the plains near the border with
              New Mexico. Friday night football, oil, and church are pretty much
              the name of the game. It is hundreds of miles away from the
              nearest city of any sort of national significance, but the region
              as a whole punches above its weight economically because of the
              scale of oil and gas production that goes on there. It's a city
              that never sleeps, with the drone of semi trucks and the low,
              steady clang of oil pumpjacks filling the air all through the
              night.

              I went to college at the University of Texas at Austin. Moving to
              Austin was a bit of culture shock for me because I hadn't really
              spent any time in cities. Because of its politics, music scene,
              and hippie-friendly vibes, it is something of an island deep in
              the heart of Texas – which is encapsulated by the city's
              unofficial motto, "Keep Austin Weird." Life in Austin is defined
              by barbecue, Texas country, tacos for breakfast, tubing down the
              river, traffic, heat, eight-o-clocks standing on the Congress
              Avenue Bridge watching bats fill the sky, etc.

              Kharkiv is the largest city in the eastern part of Ukraine, and I
              spent my final year of college studying abroad there. Home to many
              of the country's top-ranking universities, it is a largely
              Russian-speaking city but is nonetheless an important center of
              Ukrainian cultural life. My program there was cut short by the
              turmoil caused by Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. Now Russia
              has set its sights on Kharkiv as essentially ground zero of its
              crusade to wipe Ukraine off the map.

              Russia – with all its many flaws – holds a special place in my
              heart. I spent three different stints there studying Russian (in
              summer 2011 and summer v2012) and interning at a university
              (2014-15). Moscow is one of the world's largest cities, and it is
              a city of lots of contrasts. It is breathtakingly historical and
              grotesquely modern; it is oppressively concrete, but also boasts
              some of the world's nicest urban green spaces; it's home to the
              most generous and most repugnant people on the planet. While
              you're unlikely to be visiting Moscow or Russia any time soon, it
              definitely deserves a spot on your bucket list - even if it comes
              dead last.

              Albuquerque is New Mexico's largest city, an isolated desert
              landscape at the foothills of the Sandia Mountains. Characterized
              by green chiles, stucco houses, wind-swept mesas, Navajo fry bread
              and Breaking Bad, the pace of life there is notoriously slow.
              There's not really too much going on in Albuquerque, but the
              gorgeous sunsets, amazing food, and easy proximity to mountains,
              forests, rivers, and ancient native settlements make it an
              attractive place to live. But Albuquerque is no Seattle – New
              Mexico is one of the country's poorest states and issues such as
              violent crime, drug addiction, and childhood poverty rear their
              head in an unfortunate way in the city.

              I lived in Estonia for two years during grad school. Estonia is a
              tiny country of around 1.3 million people wedged in the corner of
              northeastern Europe. Culturally, it has heavy German and Nordic
              influences, and the national language is a close sibling of
              Finnish. However, it also has a large Russian-speaking population
              – it was part of the Russian Empire for 200 years and then
              following WWII, it was occupied by the Soviet Union. Today,
              Estonia is a very peaceful, quiet country with a booming tech and
              tourism industry and endless forests, bogs, and lakes. But if you
              go during the winter be ready to suffer, because the sun sets in
              November and doesn't come back out until April.
